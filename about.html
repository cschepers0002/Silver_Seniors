    <div class="about-columns">
      <p>Silver Seniors was founded by Sharon Rutherford in the early 2000â€™s in Louisville, Kentucky. She worked in a physical therapy clinic as a technician assisting physical therapists and working directly with patients. This is where she grew a love for one-on-one patient interaction and the senior community. She saw a community that needed help and felt the need to answer.
      </p>
      <p>In early 2001, she began the non-profit process that eventually led to what you know as Silver Seniors today. She did not do this alone; she started an all-star team to help create the exact company she was envisioning. Most of the original team remain within the organization in leadership roles.</p>

      <p>Silver Seniors first goal was to create a gym where senior citizens could work out in an environment of peers. Mrs. Rutherford saw firsthand the need for this environment. Often, she would overhear patients at her physical therapy clinic, complaining about how regular gyms were not organized best for those who are weak or immobile.
      </p>
      <p>Another complaint would be the patrons at the gym, typically much younger and not empathic to the senior community. Therefore, senior citizens in the Louisville area needed a gym that was designed to best function older patrons and to serve as a place to be around people that share common interests and goals.</p>

      <p>Over the years, Silver Seniors has expanded from a small gym to an entire campus serving the greater Louisville area. Although the scenery is different from when Mrs. Rutherford first started the organization, the mission remains the same.
